# How's it going? 👋👨🏽‍💻💬

I'm Adrian! A Veteran, a Business Student and an all-around enthusiast for self-improvement on this road called life. Recently transitioned into Software Development, as an abstract thinker and creative problem-solver, whether it's front-end or back-end, I look forward to learning and completing the challenge.

🌱&nbsp; I'm learning JS while honing my HTML and CSS skills<br>
🎓&nbsp; Currently a spirited pupil at [Codeup](https://codeup.com)<br>
✨&nbsp; <em>Fun fact</em>: My username is a nod to my childhood inspiration to learn code: Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tirvuski IV -or- RadicalEdward<br>
